Hi, Iâ€™m Bianca Sangiovanni! ðŸ‘‹

I'm interested in **robotics**, **reinforcement learning** and **deep learning applications** to real-world problems. 

This is my personal repository, containing the code I write while studying. At this stage, most repositories are private: for inquiries, please reach me through the contact information at https://bsangiovanni.github.io/ .
